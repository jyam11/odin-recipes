            <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
        </h3>

        <ul> 
            <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon baking powder </li>
            <li> ¼ teaspoon baking soda  </li>
            <li> ¼ teaspoon salt  </li>
            <li> ⅓ cup buttermilk </li>
            <li> 6 tablespoons cold, unsalted butter, cut into pieces  </li>
            <li> ½ cup pumpkin puree </li>
            <li> ⅓ cup toasted pine nuts </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed </li>
            <li> 1 egg </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon milk </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon white sugar </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
            <strong>Directions:</strong>
        </h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
            <li>Whisk together 1 3/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl until combined. Mix butter into flour mixture using a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the center of the flour-butter mixture. Stir in pumpkin puree, buttermilk, and pine nuts until just combined.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a work surface with 2 tablespoons flour. Turn out dough onto the floured work surface. Shape into a rectangle about 1 inch thick. Fold the rectangle in thirds, sprinkle with more flour as needed, and flatten to about 1 inch thick. Repeat 2 more times. Cut final rectangle into 6 equally-sized squares. Cut each square into triangles and transfer the scones to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg and milk together in a small bowl. Lightly brush the top of each scone with egg wash. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon sugar over scones.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
